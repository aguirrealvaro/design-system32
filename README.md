# UI Kit

React component library and custom hooks. Personally, I'm not a big fan of any component library, so I've been creating my own components. Being the owner of my code makes it easier for me to customize and extend them based on my needs. It offers typical components of a design system out of the box such as Dialog, Alert, Accordion, Button, etc.

`npm install`

`npm run storybook`
